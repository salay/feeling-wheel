<p>
	I created this emotion wheel because I've found it helpful to be able to identify emotions around an issue (especially interpersonal ones which require clear, coherent communication) in order to get to the root cause of the issue and create a solution.</p>

<p>
	There have been many times at which I've been at a loss for words to describe what I'm feeling. This wheel breaks down emotions into eight main categories, then splits each category into secondary and tertiary categories. 

	<!-- Each category has a link to the definition of the emotion, the opposite of that emotion, and a link to a quote to either describe and validate the emotion or evoke the opposite -->
</p>
<p>
	The concept of an emotion wheel (or feeling wheel) is not new.
	Robert Putnam has made one here.
</p>
<p>
	Something that I observed while researching previously created emotional wheels is the sheer amount, variance, and diversity of human expression we each have, much of which isn't encapsulated in the wheels. This version was based of off the Junto wheel (here), which is one of the more comprehensive wheels I've found. It by no means, however, contains the full spectrum of human emotions.
</p>
<p>
I've also found that despite this vast variety of emotional expression, the English language often comes up short in concisely describing several commonly experiences states (the classical example being the word "love" connoting several distinct meanings that are hard to decipher from each other when only one word is used in communication).
</p>
<p> Other languages may be better at describing some of the emotional states whenever English is lacking. 
</p>
<p>
But perhaps some emotions are meant to remain ineffable. 
</p>
There is also the issue of whether assigning a particular word to an emotion may replace that actual state of feeling with the expectation of what the word is supposed to feel like. However, in the realm of communication, it is hard to convey certain emotional states (apart from the basic 4-8 ones universally recognized facial expressions) without words; thereby, necessitating the use of words as a vehicle of conveyance.

This is why I believe it is so important to find the most accurate words to describe and convey a particular emotional state or feeling about something to another person. The imporatance of language comes in our ability to have a common understanding of what the other person is experiencing and trying to convey. 

Otherwise, how can we relate to others and thereby forge relationships if we can't recognize that of which is commonly understood between us.
